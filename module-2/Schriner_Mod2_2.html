   <h1> Assignment 2.2 â€“ Building a Web Page Exercise, Part 2</h1>
   <h2> Personal Introduction </h2>
  
   <p>My name is Jason Schriner, and I am originally from New York. Currently, I live in South Carolina, where I have settled down to continue building my career. I work for a large retailer at a distribution facility, where I oversee the shipping operations. As a supervisor, I am responsible for managing a team of up to 21 people, ensuring smooth and efficient workflow in the shipping department. This role has given me valuable leadership experience and insight into the logistics industry.</p>

   <h2>Goals</h2>
   <p>I am currently studying software development at Bellevue University, with the goal of shifting my career into the tech industry. After years of working in a physically demanding role in distribution, I am looking for a career that is less physically taxing and offers more long-term growth opportunities. <span class = "sentence">Software development excites me because it provides a chance to use problem-solving skills in a rapidly growing field, and I see it as a path that will allow me to build a more sustainable and fulfilling career.</span> Through my studies, I aim to gain the skills and experience needed to transition into this dynamic industry.</p>

   <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
   <p>I am someone who finds enjoyment in a wide variety of activities, often choosing hobbies based on the interests of those around me. I prefer to share experiences with others, as I find that participating in activities together makes them more enjoyable. However, one hobby I truly appreciate on my own is saltwater fishkeeping. I am constantly amazed by the vibrant colors and intricate patterns of the fish, and I find it relaxing to care for my aquarium. The hobby offers me a sense of calm and wonder, as I can observe the delicate ecosystems I've created and continue to learn about marine life.</p>
   
   <h2>Future Aspirations</h2>
   <p> Over the next few years, I plan to focus on growing my knowledge and advancing in my career, aiming for a more comfortable lifestyle in the future. I am dedicated to building a solid foundation in software development, and I believe that by continuing to learn and develop my skills, I can achieve the career growth I'm striving for. In the next 5 to 10 years, one of my main goals is to secure a remote job, which would allow me more flexibility and the opportunity to travel. I look forward to balancing a fulfilling career with the freedom to explore new places and experiences.</p>
